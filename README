[+] Introduction
-------------------------------

  This is a modified version of the Lynis tool from CISOfy (https://cisofy.com/lynis/). 
  It has been customized   to meet specific needs and additional features have been added.
  
  modLynis  is an auditing tool which tests and gathers (security) information from
  Unix based systems. The audience for this tool are security and system
  auditors, network specialists and system maintainers.

  Some of the (future) features and usage options:
  - System and security audit checks
  - Compliance testing
  - File integrity monitoring
  - System and file forensics
  - Usage of templates/baselines (reporting and monitoring)
  - Extended debugging features

  Everyone is free to use Lynis under the conditions of the GPL v3 license (see

[+] Installation
-------------------------------

  Lynis doesn't have to be installed, so it can be used directly from a
  (removable) disk. If you want the program to be installed, use one of the
  following methods:

  - Create a custom directory (ie. /usr/local/lynis) and unpack the tarball
    (tar xfvz lynis-version.tar.gz) into this directory.
  - Create a RPM package by using the lynis.spec file (see web site)
    run 'rpmbuild -ta lynis-version.tar.gz' (= build RPM package)
    run 'rpm -ivh <filename>' (= install RPM package)

  See online documentation for detailed instructions.



[+] Supported systems

  Since the complexity of auditing different systems and platforms, Lynis is
  developed on BSD and Linux.

  This tool is tested or confirmed to work with at least:
  AIX, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, macOS, Solaris. See the website for the full
  list of tested operating systems.
